Tool for transport of serial interfaces over UDP/IP.
Usefull for accessing a distant serial device by a local Windoze program.

Example
=======

--------   Serial    --------                -------   Serial   ---------
|Serial|   Cross     |Remote|   (Internet)   |Local|   Cross    |Windoze|
|Device|-------------|Linux |---..........---|Linux|------------|program|
--------   Cable     --------                -------   Cable    ---------


One linux will be server and one will be client.
On the server you can start the program typing the following command:

bash# serialoverip -d /dev/ttyS0 9600-8n1 -s 127.0.0.1 3000

... and on the client:

bash# serialoverip -c 127.0.0.1 3000 -d /dev/ttyS1 9600-8n1

In both commands the IP address is the server IP.
Note that you have to start the server first, and it will be efectively be running
only after the first packet received from the client.
